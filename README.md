## About
Election Day is a game about the importance of delivery when you’re giving a speech. Help Marcus by typing his speech as he delivers it. The better your delivery score in each of the 5 rounds, the more votes he will get.

## Instructions
Type the words before they enter the Thought Bubble (top). Press the space bar when each word turn green in order to speak them (and have them show up in the Speech Bubble (bottom)). The word turns green if it has been completely typed and is in the thought bubble. If the words reach the bottom of the thought bubble without being completed and submitted with the space bar, you will miss those points.

For example, in the example below, you have already typed in `DETENTION`, and you must now hit space to submit it to the speech bubble.

But in the example below, it looks like you didn’t type in `STUDENTS` in time, and you won’t have the chance to finish and hit space in order to speak it.

Marcus can still win the election even though Riley is out to get him, but he needs your help!
